$R^2_X(cum)$: "Cumulative SS of all the Xs explained by all extracted components".
This is the same for PCA and PLS.
There arent actual equations for these in the book, so this is my best shot:

$$
R^2_X = \sum_i 1- \frac{SS_i}{SS_{X}}???
$$
where *i* is each component?

$R^2_Y(cum)$: "Cumulative SS of all the Ys explained by all extracted components"

$$
R^2_Y = \sum_i 1- \frac{SS_i}{SS_Y}???
$$

$Q^2(cum)$: "The fraction of the total variation of the Ys that can be predited by a component according to cross-validation"

$$
Q^2 = 1 - PRESS/SS_{total}
$$
Predicted Error Sum of Squares (PRESS) is squared differences between observed Y and predicted values when observations were kept out (because of cross-validation).
$$
PRESS = \sum_{i}\sum_{m}(Y_{im} - \hat{Y}_{im})^2
$$
So...
$$
Q^2(cum) = (1 - \prod(PRESS/SS)_a) \;\;\;\; [a = 1,...A]
$$

where $\prod(PRESS/SS)_a$ = the product of PRESS/SS for each individual component a.


$p_{Q^2}$ and $p_{R^2}$:

derived from perumtation test.

Upper limit for p:

$$
p = \frac{1 + \#(Q^2_{p} \leq Q^2)}{N}
$$
