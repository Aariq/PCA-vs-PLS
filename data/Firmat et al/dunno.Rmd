```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(ropls)
library(chemhelper)
```

can't remember what these data are, but the PCA just does too good of a job.


```{r}
leaves <- read_delim(here("data", "Firmat et al", "Table_Figure1.txt"), " ")
```
PCA
```{r}
leaves.pca <- opls(leaves %>% select(-Elevation), predI = 2)
pca_pd <- get_plotdata(leaves.pca)
ggplot(pca_pd$scores, aes(x = p1, y = p2, color = leaves$Elevation)) +geom_point()
```


PLSR
```{r}
leaves.opls <- opls(leaves %>% select(-Elevation), leaves$Elevation, predI = 1 , orthoI = 1)
plot_opls(leaves.opls)
```
