```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
```


```{r}
raw <- read_delim(here("data", "Defossez et al.", "all_data_ind.csv"), ";")
```

```{r}
raw
```

It looks like the "C" treatment rows contain all the info.  Need to look back at paper to figure out what the deal is with ones without an ID

```{r}
raw %>% 
  filter(treatment == "C", !is.na(ID)) %>% skim()
```

```{r}
library(skimr)
```
