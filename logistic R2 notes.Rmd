```{r}

# Mcfadden R2

```{r}
1 - (logLik(m) / logLik(m0))
```

# Cox and Snell R2

```{r}
n = nrow(beaver2)
1 - (exp(as.numeric(logLik(m0))) / exp(as.numeric(logLik(m)))) ^ (2/n)

```
woah, pretty different

# Tjur R2
Best according to https://statisticalhorizons.com/r2logistic

>The definition is very simple. For each of the two categories of the dependent variable, calculate the mean of the predicted probabilities of an event. Then, take the difference between those two means. Thatâ€™s it!


```{r}
yhat <- predict(m, type = "response")
yhat

yhat <- augment(m, type.predict = "response")
yhat %>%
  group_by(activ) %>% 
  summarize(means = mean(.fitted)) %>% 
  summarize(R2_tjur = diff(means))
```
